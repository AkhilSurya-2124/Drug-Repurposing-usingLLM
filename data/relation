Suppose you are an expert in Drug Discovery and Large Language Model.

107 different text blocks retrieved from a drug repurposing dataset given below. Each text block has 2 mandatory key-value ("interaction-entities", "interaction-type") and 1 optional key-value pair ("interaction-description").

Convert each of these key-value pairs to a single line in NATURAL LANGUAGE which can be effectively feed to a LLM for fine-tuning purpose. Use natural language fillers where necessary. Provide python code to automate the process. You should code to handle ALL 107 cases listed below.

Natural language examples after conversion:

"There is a protein-protein interaction between Gene 2157 and itself."
"Gene 2157 and Gene 5264 are involved in a protein-protein interaction."
"Gene 170622 and Gene 404636 exhibit an interaction that is categorized as 'other', indicating it doesn't belong to other predefined interaction types."
"A reaction is observed between Gene 29099 and Gene 1643."
"Gene 51645 and Gene 3183 are involved in a reaction type of interaction."
"Gene 865 and Gene 983 are engaged in a catalysis interaction."
"There is a binding interaction between Gene 1066 and Gene 7365."
"Gene 6118 and Gene 1111 are involved in a binding type of interaction."

interaction-entities: Gene::5581 and Compound::DB00371
interaction-type: activation
interaction-description: An activator interaction is when a drug activates a biological response from a target, although the mechanism by which it does so may not be understood.

interaction-entities: Gene::4988 and Compound::DB00708
interaction-type: agonism
interaction-description: An agonist interaction occurs when a drug binds to a target receptor and activates the receptor to produce a biological response.

interaction-entities: Gene::2893 and Compound::CHEMBL1255648
interaction-type: allosteric modulation
interaction-description: An allosteric modulator interaction occurs when drugs exert their effects on their protein targets via a different binding site than the natural (orthosteric) ligand site.

interaction-entities: Gene::135 and Compound::CHEMBL72862
interaction-type: antagonism
interaction-description: An antagonist interaction occurs when a drug blocks or dampens agonist-mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a target receptor.

interaction-entities: Gene::1493 and Compound::DB06186
interaction-type: antibody
interaction-description: An antibody interaction occurs when an antibody drug specifically binds the target molecule.

interaction-entities: Gene::10280 and Compound::DB04272
interaction-type: binding
interaction-description: A binder interaction has drugs physically binding to their target.

interaction-entities: Gene::11280 and Compound::CHEMBL3545209
interaction-type: blocking
interaction-description: Antagonist interactions are sometimes referred to as blocker interactions; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

interaction-type: channel blocking

interaction-entities: Gene::1022 and Compound::DB05969
interaction-type: inhibition
interaction-description: In inhibitor interactions, the drug binds to a target and decreases its expression or activity. Most interactions of this class are enzyme inhibitors, which bind an enzyme to reduce enzyme activity.

interaction-entities: Gene::778 and Compound::DB12105
interaction-type: modulation
interaction-description: In modulator interactions, the drug regulates or changes the activity of its target. In contrast to allosteric modulators, this interaction type may not involve any direct binding to the target.

interaction-entities: Gene::348 and Compound::DB00635
interaction-type: other
interaction-description: This is a label given by the reporting source to an interaction that doesn't belong to other interaction types, as defined by the reporting source.

interaction-entities: Gene::3350 and Compound::CHEMBL1200399
interaction-type: partial agonism
interaction-description: In a partial antagonist interaction, a drug will only partially reduce the amplitude of a functional response at its target receptor, as compared to the reduction of response by a full antagonist.

interaction-entities: Gene::2903 and Compound::CHEMBL1255840
interaction-type: positive allosteric modulation
interaction-description: In a positive allosteric modulator interaction, the drug increases activity of the target enzyme.

interaction-entities: Compound::DB00023 and Gene::6906
interaction-type: carrier
interaction-description: Gene acts as a carrier which binds to a drug and modifies its pharmacokinetics.

interaction-entities: Compound::DB00001 and Compound::DB06605
interaction-type: drug-drug interaction
interaction-description: In DrugBank, this relation refers to a change in a drug's effect on the body when the drug is taken with other drugs.

interaction-entities: Compound::DB00006 and Gene::4353
interaction-type: enzyme
interaction-description: Gene acts as an enzyme that facilitates the occurrence of a metabolic reaction by interacting with and transforming a drug or chemical to one or more specific metabolites.
