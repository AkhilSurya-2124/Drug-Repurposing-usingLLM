## Dataset Description
We have used the Drug Repurposing Knowledge Graph (DRKG) dataset (https://github.com/gnn4dr/DRKG) for the project. DRKG is a comprehensive biological knowledge graph relating genes, compounds, diseases, biological processes, side effects and symptoms. DRKG includes information from six existing databases including DrugBank, Hetionet, GNBR, String, IntAct and DGIdb. It includes 97,238 entities belonging to 13 entity-types; and 5,874,261 triplets belonging to 107 edge-types. These 107 edge-types show a type of interaction between one of the 17 entity-type pairs (multiple types of interactions are possible between the same entity-pair), as depicted in the figure below.

## Project Objective

To build synergized **[KG-LLM model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302.pdf)** that can advance the state-of-the-art drug discovery, our project aimed to build a prototype with **Retrieval Augmented Generation** on **Knowledge Graphs,** harnessing the power of **open-source LLMs**.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graph

## Fine-tuning LLM

## Discussion

- At first, we aimed to implement RAG on Graph a.k.a. Graph RAG. Thus, we have explored graph databases like [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), [nebula-graph](https://www.nebula-graph.io/), [aws neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) and some others that can support Graph RAG. However, the free tier of the technologies are not feasible for our dataset as we have ~0.4M nodes and ~5.8M edges. This feasibility study took apporimately 20 hours of work.
